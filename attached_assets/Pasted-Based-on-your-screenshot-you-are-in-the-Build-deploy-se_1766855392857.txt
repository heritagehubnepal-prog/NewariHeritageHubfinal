Based on your screenshot, you are in the **Build & deploy settings** of your Netlify project, specifically in the **"Enforce deployment methods"** section.

### 🎯 Your Goal

You want to **fix the issue where your Netlify Function `api` is not being deployed or resolved**, which is causing your admin dashboard to show a blank page after login.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide: Where to Go and What to Do

---

### 📍 STEP 1: Go Back to “Build settings”

You’re currently in the “Enforce deployment methods” section. This is **not** where you fix your function deployment.

→ Scroll up or click the **“Back”** button in your browser to return to the main **“Build settings”** form.

This is where you can edit:

- Runtime (Node.js version)
- Base directory
- Package directory
- Build command
- Publish directory
- Functions directory
- Environment variables

---

### 🛠️ STEP 2: Set the Correct “Functions directory”

In the “Build settings” form:

- Find the field labeled **“Functions directory”**
- Make sure it’s set to:  
  ```
  netlify/functions
  ```

> ✅ This tells Netlify where to look for your functions. If it’s set to something else (like `functions`), change it to `netlify/functions`.

> ⚠️ If you have a folder named `functions/` at the root of your repo, this setting should be `functions/`. But if you have a folder named `netlify/functions`, then use that.

---

### 🧪 STEP 3: Ensure Your Build Command Is Correct

Your **Build command** should be:
```
npm run build
```

This is correct if you have a `build` script in your `package.json` that runs `vite build`.

If you also need to compile TypeScript functions, you might need to add a step:
```
npm run build && npm run build:functions
```

But first, let’s fix the basic setup.

---

### 📦 STEP 4: Set the “Publish directory”

This should be:
```
dist
```

> ✅ This is where Vite outputs your built frontend files.

---

### 🌐 STEP 5: Add a `.nvmrc` File to Your Repo (Recommended)

To ensure Netlify uses the correct Node.js version:

1. Create a file named `.nvmrc` in the root of your repository.
2. Add this line:
   ```
   20
   ```
3. Commit and push it to GitHub.

This ensures Netlify uses Node.js v20 during builds — matching most modern frontend tooling.

---

### 🔍 STEP 6: Check Your `netlify.toml`

Make sure your `netlify.toml` looks like this:

```toml
[build]
  functions = "netlify/functions"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/api"
  status = 200
```

> ✅ This tells Netlify where to find your functions and how to route API requests.

---

### 🚀 STEP 7: Redeploy

After making these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify Function deployment"
git push
```

Netlify will automatically redeploy.

---

### 🛡 Bonus: Clear the Build Cache (If Needed)

Sometimes, old cached dependencies cause issues.

Go to **Deploys → Trigger a new deploy → Click “Clear cache and deploy”**

This forces Netlify to reinstall all dependencies fresh.

🤖 Replit Agent Guidelines: Set Up Cultural Quiz Levels & Badges
Instructions for the AI Agent in Replit:
You are helping build Heritage Hub Nepal, a cultural education platform focused on Newari heritage.
Do not change existing working code. Only add new files or minimal enhancements to support difficulty levels and badges in the Cultural Quiz.

🎯 Goal
Implement a 3-level quiz system (Easy, Medium, Hard) with unique completion badges, using pure frontend logic (no backend, no login).

📁 1. Update Question Data Structure
In src/data/quizData.ts (or wherever questions are stored):
Add a new field: difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
Keep all existing fields (question, options, correct, explanation, character)
Do not change logic — just extend the type and add the field to each question (use placeholder values like 'medium' for now)
✅ Example:

ts
123456789
🖼️ 2. Create Difficulty Selector Component
Create new file: src/components/QuizSelector.tsx
Must export a React component that:
Shows a centered card with title: “Choose Your Challenge”
Has 3 buttons (use existing .btn class if available):
🌱 Easy (5 Questions) → calls onSelect('easy')
🏯 Medium (8 Questions) → calls onSelect('medium')
🔥 Hard (12 Questions) → calls onSelect('hard')
Style buttons with:
Easy: background: #4CAF50
Medium: background: #FF9800
Hard: background: #F44336
✅ Return props type:

ts
123
🔧 3. Add Quiz Filtering Logic
Create new file: src/utils/quizUtils.ts
Export two functions:
ts
123456789101112
💡 Badge Rules (hardcode these):

Easy + ≥70% → { name: "Heritage Seed", icon: "🌱", color: "#4CAF50" }
Medium + ≥80% → { name: "Cultural Explorer", icon: "🏯", color: "#FF5722" }
Hard + ≥90% → { name: "Heritage Guardian", icon: "🛡️", color: "#9C27B0" }
Else → { name: "Curious Learner", icon: "📚", color: "#2196F3" }
🎨 4. Update Quiz & Result Screens (Minimal Changes)
In Quiz.tsx:
Accept difficulty as prop
Use getQuizQuestions() to load correct question set
In ResultScreen.tsx:
Accept difficulty, score, total
Use getBadge() to show badge in a styled pill (use color for background, white text)
✅ Do not redesign layout — just insert badge display below score.

🧪 5. Keep It Lightweight & Safe
No external dependencies
No API calls
No localStorage unless already used
Preserve existing scroll-to-top, character logic, and feedback colors
